            This is a project done under the guidance of Prof. Anirudha Joshi during the Monsoon course on HCI 2019. The course is a 15 days hands-on deep dive into HCI processes to solve user problems.</br></br>We started with design a design brief, conducted contextual user interviews, analysed the observations and proposed a solution. The goal of this project was to uncover the nuances of the problems using different UX processes than coming with the final solution.</br></br>More details about the project in the slides below.

          Besides the major HCI processes like conducting the contextual enquiry, affinity & persona mapping, and conducting user testing. We learned more broad things like when to expand and focus on identified problems. How to set the goal of a given project? How to get stakeholders buy-in for investing in HCI processes? and many more.
