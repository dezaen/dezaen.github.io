              description :
                After trying a lot of ideas, we choose to go with the Benzene structure and made a dent into it to create “E” for the Elucidata. The benzene ring is a very known and easily recognizable compound to both the persona( potential hires and clients ). Benzene depicts the stability and its sharp edges in the figure depict the cutting edge technology that Elucidata works on.

          description : 
            I went through various typefaces on google fonts, as I wanted to pick a unique sans-serif typeface for UI of the product and Serif typeface for the content-heavy pages. Like Website, Blogs, Letterhead, Slides etc. I choose Heebo and Merriweather. Heebo is an optically corrected typeface which is similar to Roboto. You will notice the difference only in use. It gave the product a unique personality and fulfilled all the need of any professional quality typeface. Merriweather, on the other hand, gelled perfectly with it and looked beautiful at all different sizes.

              description :
                During our discussion the stakeholders wanted the brand to speak for simplicity, seriousness, trust, cutting edge and freshness. To achieve this I looked at more than 100 Biotech companies on Angellist and observed that there were very few companies which were using shades of purple. As purple closely resembles with most of the words above. After trying out different contrasts and shades of purple. We settled down with the below palette.

          description : This project helped me understand the value of inclusion from different stakeholders. As their feedback were really helpful in finalizing the final design. Once the logo was finalized. We showed it to employees and asked their feedback about the logo and branding guidelines. Almost all of them liked the designed and wanted to know the rationale behind Why this color? Why that font? Why this shape? etc. In the end, they all had their doubts cleared and supported the design decisions.

          description : I learned about brand strategy in the process of designing the logo. My mentor helped me see the bigger picture of, How will the logo be used in different contexts? We primarily focused on Print and Digital media. In Print, we had to consider the design of product sheets, Leaflets, scientific posters, visiting cards and in Digital media we had Website, Product, Social Media, Emailers etc.
