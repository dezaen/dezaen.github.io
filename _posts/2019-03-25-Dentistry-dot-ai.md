            We are living in a busy world where we are not conscious of our food habits. People start to get dental problems at relatively early years of their life. Stats show that close to 40% people start to experience these problems at the age of 35. Few most common causes are smoking, drinking soft drinks, and not brushing teeth regularly. This gives rise to problems like tooth sensitivity, tooth decay, gum issues etc.<br>In the world with a high patient to doctor ratio. It has become hard to give enough care to every patient and look into the problem closely.<br>This gives rise to more human errors and poor patient care. Dentistry.io is an AI-enabled caries detection tool. It aims to help dentists take some load off their shoulders. By analyzing X-ray scans of the tooth to detect caries and also help predict them at an early stage.

            To understand the depth of the problem. I started to read about the application of Machine Learning in healthcare and came across many articles and posts. I asked my teammate for help,  who headed the AI department at paralleldots. He suggested me to go through a few papers. I understood how Machine Learning is used to detect caries in the x-ray scans. Later I had an unstructured 1-1 user interview with 3 internal stakeholders( product manager, domain expert, and marketing head ) to understand the problem, business and the future opportunity with this project. It helped me understand the depth of the problem and also the terms used in the domain. As a result, I got to know the challenges faced by dentists.<br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>Dentists wanted to manually verify detected caries.</li>
              <li>Since they get plenty of patients and respectively many x-ray scans. They could not look at all of them at once.</li>
              <li>Apart from caries they also wanted the product to detect bone loss</li>
              <li>Looking and verifying the healing was difficult for a patient.</li>
              <li>The company wanted to sell different plans based on the usage of the product.</li>
            </ol>

                After understanding the user and what they wanted out of the product. I created user flow based on my understanding. A dentist can upload their x-ray scan and after successful upload, they can analyze the result. They can also compare the previous scans to see the result of the treatment.

            We went to a few local dentists at Artemis hospital and showed our prototype to a few dentists. Following were the feedbacks that we gathered. Which we immediately converted into product features.
            <ol>
              <li>They wanted to quickly find the older reports for a patient</li>
              <li>Compare the reports to see the progress</li>
              <li>Annotate the x-ray scans so that they can remember the findings in a report</li>
            </ol>
