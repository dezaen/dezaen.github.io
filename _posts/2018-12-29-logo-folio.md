            Sometimes I wonder, In this digital world, things change so rapidly that your work gets lost in the updates. As a designer I always want my designs to be timeless, and to create timeless design it takes a lot for something to come up. Logos or identity of a company or product, I think from the plethora of design work is something that stays visible for long. Below are some of them which I am most proud of.
