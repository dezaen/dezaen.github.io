            Did you know? It takes 10-15 years for a new drug to come to the market and it costs almost a billion dollar. Elucidata at its core is trying to reduce the time to find the target for a drug and thus reduce the cost. <br><br>Polly<sup>TM</sup> is a one-stop solution for finding insights from metabolomics experiments. The traditional way of analyzing metabolomic dataset is lengthy and broken. An expert with 3-5 years of experience takes a week to analyze a dataset acquired from an experiment.
