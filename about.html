        <h3>Interests <span>üíõ</span></h3>
        <p>I am interested in art, spirituality, stoicism, karma yoga, entrepreneurship, and simple living. When I am not working, I spend my time listening to podcasts, blogs, and sometimes books, although I can't remember the last time I finished one. I read for curiosity and to explore the questions I ask myself.</p>
        <p>.... ummmnn.. and dream of touring Iceland and experiencing its beautiful landscapes, people, culture, and music. Some of my all-time favorite musicians are Sigur Ros, Olafur Arnalds, Nils Frahm, Hans Zimmer, and Krishna Das.</p>
