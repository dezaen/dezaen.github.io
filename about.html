      <h2>Hello,</h2>
      <p>
        I am Niranjan Gupta. A Front End Engineer turned User Experience Designer from New Delhi, India.<br><br>

        I like building products which make the world a little less painful. Previously I worked with <a href="http://www.elucidata.io" target="_blank">Elucidata</a>, <a href="https://www.paralleldots.com" target="_blank">Paralleldots</a>, Surgge( closed now ), <a href="http://www.bhane.com" target="_blank">bhane</a>, and <a href="http://www.tapzo.com" target="_blank">Tapzo</a>. That said I am always up for solving the next problem and working with like-minded people.

        <br><br> As a UX Designer, my goal is to create user-friendly, scalable and innovative experiences which focus on understanding both customer and business needs. During my work, I try to define design goals, business goals and then selecting the right user-centered design methodologies to craft the best experience. I combine my UX knowledge with Graphic Design, Front End Engineering skills to create feasible interfaces which are user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. When I am not working, I enjoy watching movies, fiddling with my guitar, reading blogs and experimenting with my cooking skills.

        <p>I have been working in the design industry for about 6 years now and I have made peace with the fact that Design’s main job is to simplify things, make things live longer, and help make humans live a happier life. It is something which needs a balance of both creative and analytic side of my brain. My works are heavily inspired by Dieter Ram’s and John Maeda’s principles around simplicity. I am a curious soul who wants to know who, how, what, and why behind everything around me.</p>
